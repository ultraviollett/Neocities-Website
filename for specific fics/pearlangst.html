    Dear Pearl,
<br><br>
    Please answer this letter when you get it, Gem told
    me she hasn't seen you since Friday and is 
    concerned. Hopefully I'm overreacting, but better
    safe than sorry!

    Dear Pearl

<br><Br>
I can tell the letters are reaching you, 
but you’re moving too quickly for Gem to reach. 
I don’t know what’s happening or if you’ve even
 read these, but everyone on Empires will keep
  looking for you, and we’ll find you. Just hold tight.

    The last letter couldn’t find you, I don’t know why.

    The letters can’t track you. I’ve never had that happen before. Please, wherever you are, please be safe.

            Dear Grian,
        <br><br>
        I am sorry to be writing to you with bad news. No one at Empires has seen Pearl for a week, and I've tried to contact her through letters but they haven’t been reaching her, and I've never had that happen to me. There could be a few reasons for either, and all the emperors are searching for her. I'm going to write letters to a few others as well. Is there a chance she's visiting you on Hermitcraft, or she's told you where she is?
<br><br>Wishing you well,
<br><br>
Scott

        Dear Xisuma, 
    <br><br>
    I am writing to you about Pearlescentmoon. I don't know if Grian’s told you, but she disappeared twelve days ago and no one can find her. We've taken a look at Empires' log and seen the day she left, but none of us here are super skilled in the area, so i was wondering if you could take a look. If so, you can either come here or I can send you the logs we recorded if you can’t make it.
    <br><br>Thank you for your help,
    <br><br>
    Scott

    Dear Taurtis,
 <br><br>
 Has Pearl visited you in the past few weeks? She’s gone, and she'd been talking about Evo in the days before she disappeared - sorry if that stirs up bad memories, but I’m getting a bit desperate. None of my letters can find her, and I've tried many different things and they are not working

<br><br>Thank you,
<br><br>
Scott

    Dear Ivorycello,
     <br><br>
     One of my friends and servermates, Pearlescentmoon, has been missing for a few weeks, and the search hasn't been going well. I was wondering if you'd heard anything that could help, or knew any people who could. Any information could be helpful, we've been searching for almost a month with no leads.
    <br><br>Best wishes,
    <br><br>
    Scott

        Dear Captain,

         One of my friends, Pearlescentmoon, has been missing for more than a month without any leads. Please tell me if you have heard anything at all, no matter how small.

        <br><br>Thank you,

    Dear Docm77,
<br><br>
I'm sure Xisuma or Grian has told you about Pearlescentmoon. I know that your knowledge of code, especially unconventional code, is much deeper than most. Can we meet and help me see why my letters aren't reaching her? I don’t know what else I can do
