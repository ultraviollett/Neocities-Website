Every morning, he checked his communicator to see if Grian had returned. Every afternoon, as he worked on his mega base, he would glance in the direction of Grian’s flower pot to see if he could spot a small figure flying in the distance. Every evening, he debated about whether he should message Grian, before relenting and telling him about his day and wishing him a speedy return.

<p>Once it had hit a week since Grian left with no sign of his eminent return, Mumbo decided that just waiting around wasn’t enough.

    <p><span>&lt;MumboJumbo&gt; Xisuma, you have emergency contacts for every Hermit, right?</span></p>
    <p><span>&lt;Xisuma&gt; Yeah, I do. Why do you ask?</span></p>
    <p><span>&lt;MumboJumbo&gt; No reason. Also, for no reason, could you maybe send me Grian’s emergency contacts please?</span></p>
    <p><span>&lt;Xisuma&gt; He gave me two. Taurtis and PearlescentMoon.</span></p>
    <p><span>&lt;MumboJumbo&gt; Thanks X</span></p>
    <p><span>&lt;Xisuma&gt; No problem</span></p>

  His messages were sent, but an error message appeared after he sent the last of them.

      <p><span>&lt;Taurtis&gt; so i have good news and bad news</span></p>
      <p><span>&lt;Taurtis&gt; good news! an evolutionist knows what happened to grian!</span></p>
      <p><span>&lt;Taurtis&gt; bad news! he’s been taken by the watchers</span></p>

<br><br>
Mumbo stared blankly at his communicator. He had been 
asleep when his communicator pinged loudly, forcing
 him awake. The remnants of interrupted dreams were
  making him sluggish, his eyes unable to read the 
  words and his brain unwilling to process what they said.
  <br>
  It was made worse by Taurtis apparently mentioning
   someone (or something) that Mumbo had never heard of before.
<br><br>
  <div class="bg5 screenshot fromtop">
    <div class="chatmdbb">
      <p><span>&lt;MumboJumbo&gt; Wait, what?</span></p>
      <p><span>&lt;MumboJumbo&gt; Watchers?</span></p>
      <p><span>&lt;MumboJumbo&gt; What are those?</span></p>
      <p><span>&lt;Taurtis&gt; magical beings, i don’t really know</span></p>
      <p><span>&lt;Taurtis&gt; never really interacted with them</span></p>
      <p><span>&lt;Taurtis&gt; but they didn’t like grian</span></p>
      
    </div>
    </div>
<br><Br>
  His brain finally caught up to his eyes, and he sighed, running a hand over his face. Grian—
  <br><Br>

    <div class="bg5 screenshot">
      <div class="chatmdbb">
        <p><span>&lt;MumboJumbo&gt; Oh my word</span></p>
        <p><span>&lt;MumboJumbo&gt; What has grian gotten himself into this time</span></p>
        <p><span>&lt;Taurtis&gt; i don’t know!</span></p>
        <p><span>&lt;Taurtis&gt; i don’t get why he’s like this!</span></p>
      </div>
      </div>
  <br><Br>

  At this point, Mumbo had to admit partial defeat. He had no idea what
   “watchers” were, let alone if it was even possible to get Grian back from them.
  <Br>
  It was time to get someone else involved (or, well, more involved than they 
  currently were), someone who was more likely to know what was going on than he did.
