<p>
  <strong>HTML — </strong><br>
  aka "HyperText Markup Language", code used to create webpages. 
  You put text inside tags that makes it behave a certain way, 
  like adding a paragraph, making the text bold, or creating a list.
</p>

<div class="codedemo">
  <div class="header"><p>HTML</p></div>
  <div  class="HTMLcoding" >
    <p> &lt;p&gt;I can be <span class="highlight">&lt;b&gt;</span> bold <span class="highlight">&lt;/b&gt;</span> ...
      or <span class="highlight">&lt;i&gt;</span>italics! <span class="highlight">&lt;/i&gt;</span>&lt;/p&gt; </p>
  </div>
  <div class="header"><p>TEXT</p></div>
  <div class="text"><p>I can be <b>bold</b>...or <i>italics!</i></p> </div>

</div>
<br>
<p>
  <strong>CSS — </strong><br>
   aka "Cascading Style Sheets", code that adds style and structure to a webpage.
   It's usually put in a separate file, and then you use HTML tags to add it to the text.

</p>
<div class="codedemo">
  <div class="header"><p>CSS</p></div>
  <div  class="CSScoding" >
    <p> .pinkbox{ background-color: pink;<Br>
      padding: 5px;}
  </div>
  <div class="header"><p>HTML</p></div>
  <div  class="HTMLcoding" >
    <p> &lt;p&gt; I am in a &lt;div <span class="highlight">class = "pinkbox"</span>&gt; pink box! &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt; </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="codedemo appendcodedemo">
  <div class="header"><p>WITHOUT CSS</p></div>
  <div class="text"><p>Wow, there's a <div>pink box!</div> </p></div>
  <div class="header"><p>TEXT WITH CSS</p></div>
  <div class="text"><p>Wow, there's a <div class="pinkbox">pink box!</div> </p></div>

<strong>Ao3 Workskin — </strong><br>
 Ao3 allows you to add CSS to your work with 'workskins'. 
 Like the example above, you need the workskin to add more than just basics.
 One of the more popular things to do with workskins is to use it to mimic 
 different things - like emails, messages, and social media sites.
 it can add a lot of immersion and make your fic look a lot cooler,
 especially if its a chat fic or socmed fic.
</p>

I have links for different resources below that explain different
 things easier, but these are the basics.

<h2 id="usingworkshop">How do I use the workskin workshop?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Decide what you want to add to your fic.</li>
<li>Go to the CSS generator and generate what you will use, then add it to a workskin. There is a more indepth tutorial on 
  creating workskins <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/1370">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Generate the HTML you need with the generators. 
  Add it to your fic (when you're in HTML mode, not Rich Text mode).
</li>
<li>
Good job! It should all be working. If you notice anything off, or need any help, send me a <a href="contactform.html">message</a>.

 <h2 id="ownworkskin">How do I create my own workskin?</h2>
I'm so glad you're interested! Making workskins has always been really fun for me, and I hope it'll be for you too!
<br>I reccomend downloading VScode and the microsoft live preview extension, so you can 
work on the workskin and immediately see changes <br>
(add link here)<br>
I understand that it can be a bit intimidating to download a whole ass program for making workskins, but 
but its way easier to see your changes in real time!

<Br><br>
A few pointers: the CSS Ao3 allows you to use is limited, I've been told they'll update this in the future but just for now:
<br>-flex doesn't work besides the default (which is very helpful) (add that one link here)<br>
-grid doesn't work. try table<br>
-try not to use float, its messy<br>
-ao3 has some defaults for paragraphs that will make whats in VS code and whats in your ao3 work look different<br>
paragraphs have line breaks and margins of whatever. do this to make it go away etc
<br>
-ao3 also automatically adds paragraphs after divs, so remember that

 <h2 id="owngenerator">How would I make my own workskin generator?</h2>
 
PLEASE GOD JOIN ME<br> If you do, PLEASE let me know and I'll link it

 I've used neocities to host this site, and coded it on VScode with the help of live preview
 (add links to things that help) neocities is a static site, so everytime you reload a page, it wont remember anything from before<br>
 I used javascript with the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp">jquery library</a> to to make it easier. 
 I also used (this tutorial) to make using neocities easier<br><br>
 
Everything for this neocities is available on my github, (here).
 Make a pull request with your generator added and credit yourself!
