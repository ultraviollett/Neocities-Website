<p>
  <strong>HTML — </strong><br>
  aka "HyperText Markup Language", code used to create webpages. 
  You put text inside tags that makes it behave a certain way, 
  like adding a paragraph, making the text bold, or creating a list.
</p>

<div class="codedemo">
  <div class="header"><p>HTML</p></div>
  <div  class="HTMLcoding" >
    <p> &lt;p&gt;I can be <span class="highlight">&lt;b&gt;</span> bold <span class="highlight">&lt;/b&gt;</span> ...
      or <span class="highlight">&lt;i&gt;</span>italics! <span class="highlight">&lt;/i&gt;</span>&lt;/p&gt; </p>
  </div>
  <div class="header"><p>TEXT</p></div>
  <div class="text"><p>I can be <b>bold</b>... or <i>italics!</i></p> </div>

</div>
<br>
<p>
  <strong>CSS — </strong><br>
   aka "Cascading Style Sheets", code that adds style and structure to a webpage.
   It's usually put in a separate file, and then you use HTML tags to add it to the text.

</p>
<div class="codedemo">
  <div class="header"><p>CSS</p></div>
  <div  class="CSScoding" >
    <p> <span class="highlight">.pinkbox</span>{ background-color: pink;<Br>
      padding: 5px;}
  </div>
  <div class="header"><p>HTML</p></div>
  <div  class="HTMLcoding" >
    <p> &lt;p&gt; Wow, there's a &lt;div <span class="highlight">class = "pinkbox"</span>&gt; pink box! &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt; </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="codedemo appendcodedemo">
  <div class="header"><p>WITHOUT CSS</p></div>
  <div class="text"><p>Wow, there's a <div>pink box!</div> </p></div>
  <div class="header"><p>TEXT WITH CSS</p></div>
  <div class="text"><p>Wow, there's a <div class="pinkbox">pink box!</div> </p></div>

</div>
<br>
<p>
<strong>Ao3 Workskin — </strong><br>
 Ao3 allows you to add CSS to your work with 'workskins'. 
 Like the example above, you need the workskin to add more than just basics.
 One of the more popular things to do with workskins is to use it to mimic 
 different things - like emails, messages, and social media sites.
 it can add a lot of immersion and make your fic look a lot cooler,
 especially if its a chat fic or socmed fic.
</p>
<p>
Let's take a look at an example with the 'simple messaging' workskin:
</p>

<div class="codedemo">
  <div class="header"><p>Without Workskin</p></div>
  <div  class="text" >
    <p> Bing! You got a text! </p>
  </div>
  <div class="header"><p>With Workskin</p></div>
  <div  class="text" >
    <p> <div class="simplemsgexample">Bing! You got a text!</div></p>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
For a more indepth but still beginner-friendly explanation, I've linked a few things below.
But for the purposes of this website, as long as you know where to copy-paste everything,
you'll be able to use these generators.

<h2>How do I use the workskin workshop?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to the generator you want to use</li>
<p>I've added examples so you can see what everything looks like.
  Make sure to read the Notes so you know how it works
</p>

<li>Generate the HTML and add it to your fic</li>
<p>
  Click the 'Generate HTML' button, then click 'Copy'. Go to edit your fic,
  place the HTML where you want it. Remember, it won't look like it does in the generator 
  until you add the workskin
</p>
<li>Generate the CSS and create a workskin</li>
<p>Go to the CSS generator and generate what you will use, then add it to a workskin. There is a more indepth tutorial on 
  creating workskins <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/1370">here</a>.
  After that, go to your fic and add the workskin to it.
<li>Check everything works</li>
<p>
  Check that what you added looks good on both desktop and mobile.
All good? If not, check if you copy-pasted the HTML or CSS wrong. If it still doesn't work,
or if you notice something off, send me a <a href="contactform.html">message</a>.

I'm so glad you're interested! Making workskins has always been really fun for me, and I hope it'll be for you too!
<br>I reccomend downloading VScode and the microsoft live preview extension, so you can 
work on the workskin and immediately see changes <br>
(add link here)<br>
I understand that it can be a bit intimidating to download a whole ass program for making workskins, but 
but its way easier to see your changes in real time!

<Br><br>
A few pointers: the CSS Ao3 allows you to use is limited, I've been told they'll update this in the future but just for now:
<br>-flex doesn't work besides the default (which is very helpful) (add that one link here)<br>
-grid doesn't work. try table<br>
-try not to use float, its messy<br>
-ao3 has some defaults for paragraphs that will make whats in VS code and whats in your ao3 work look different<br>
paragraphs have line breaks and margins of whatever. do this to make it go away etc
<br>
-ao3 also automatically adds paragraphs after divs, so remember that

 <h2>How would I make my own workskin generator?</h2>
 [draft]<br>
PLEASE GOD JOIN ME<br> If you do, PLEASE let me know and I'll link it

 I've used neocities to host this site, and coded it on VScode with the help of live preview
 (add links to things that help) neocities is a static site, so everytime you reload a page, it wont remember anything from before<br>
 I used javascript with the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp">jquery library</a> to to make it easier. 
 I also used (this tutorial) to make using neocities easier<br><br>
 
Everything for this neocities is available on my github, (here).
 Make a pull request with your generator added and credit yourself!
