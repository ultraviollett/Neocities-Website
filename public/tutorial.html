<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>


<p>
  <strong>HTML — </strong>aka "HyperText Markup Language", code used to create webpages.
We can move and style this text by using CSS.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>CSS — </strong> aka "Cascading Style Sheets", code meant to add style and structure to a webpage. 
  Without CSS, webpages would different sizes of text and some inputs. There wouldn't 
  be any colour and very limited formatting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ao3 Workskin — </strong> Ao3 allows you to add CSS to your work with 'workskins'. You create a workskin on Ao3,
then add it to your fic, and the HTML in your fic will be able to reference the CSS in the workskin to use.
</p>

I have links for different resources below that explain different
 things easier, but these are the basics.
<br><br>



<h2 id="usingworkshop">How do I use the workskin workshop?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Decide what you want to add to your fic.</li>
<li>Go to the CSS generator and generate what you will use, then add it to a workskin. There is a more indepth tutorial on 
  creating workskins <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/1370">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
  Generate the HTML you need with the generators. 
  Add it to your fic (when you're in HTML mode, not Rich Text mode).
</li>
<li>
Good job! It should all be working. If you notice anything off, or need any help, send me a <a href="contactform.html">message</a>.
</li>
</ol>

 <h2 id="ownworkskin">How do I create my own workskin?</h2>
I'm so glad you're interested! Making workskins has always been really fun for me, and I hope it'll be for you too!
<br>I reccomend downloading VScode and the microsoft live preview extension, so you can 
work on the workskin and immediately see changes <br>
(add link here)<br>
I understand that it can be a bit intimidating to download a whole ass program for making workskins, but 
but its way easier to see your changes in real time!

<Br><br>
A few pointers: the CSS Ao3 allows you to use is limited, I've been told they'll update this in the future but just for now:
<br>-flex doesn't work besides the default (which is very helpful) (add that one link here)<br>
-grid doesn't work. try table<br>
-try not to use float, its messy<br>
-ao3 has some defaults for paragraphs that will make whats in VS code and whats in your ao3 work look different<br>
paragraphs have line breaks and margins of whatever. do this to make it go away etc
<br>
-ao3 also automatically adds paragraphs after divs, so remember that

 <h2 id="owngenerator">How would I make my own workskin generator?</h2>
 
PLEASE GOD JOIN ME<br> If you do, PLEASE let me know and I'll link it

 I've used neocities to host this site, and coded it on VScode with the help of live preview
 (add links to things that help) neocities is a static site, so everytime you reload a page, it wont remember anything from before<br>
 I used javascript with the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp">jquery library</a> to to make it easier. 
 I also used (this tutorial) to make using neocities easier<br><br>
 
Everything for this neocities is available on my github, (here).
 Make a pull request with your generator added and credit yourself!
